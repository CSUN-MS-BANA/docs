Culminating Project: Data-Driven Insights on Economic Growth, Public Debt, and Social Development
Objective:
This culminating project will guide students in exploring the relationship between economic growth, public debt, and social development by designing a database system, implementing it using SQLite3, and applying various analytical methods, including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Classification, Clustering, Neural Networks, Hypothesis Testing, and Time Series Analysis.
Students can either select from predefined research questions or formulate similar questions based on their selected entities and datasets while ensuring they apply the required analytical methods.
________________________________________

Step 1: Data Collection (Due: Feb 17th By Noon)
Students must download data for 2021-2023 across all countries from the following sources:
1.	World Development Indicators (WDI) – Economic, social, and environmental indicators.
2.	Statistical Indicators – Macroeconomic and trade statistics.
3.	Quarterly Public Sector Debt (QPSD) – Public debt and fiscal performance.

Step 2: Database Design & Implementation (Due: Feb 17th By Noon)

1.	Define Database Entities and Attributes
o	Countries Table (Country ID, Name, Region, Income Level)
o	Economic Indicators Table (GDP, Inflation Rate, Trade Balance, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Government Spending) - from WDI
o	Social Indicators Table (Life Expectancy, Literacy Rate, Poverty Rate, Unemployment Rate, Access to Clean Water) - from WDI
o	Public Debt Indicators Table (Total Government Debt, Debt-to-GDP Ratio, Interest Payments on Debt, External Debt Stocks) - from QPSD
o	Environmental Indicators Table (CO₂ Emissions, Renewable Energy Consumption, Access to Electricity, Forest Area) - from WDI
o	Statistical Indicators Table (Money Supply (M2), Exchange Rates) - from Statistical Indicators
Students can choose additional entities based on available data, ensuring logical relationships and normalization principles.

2.	Design an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)
o	Identify primary and foreign keys.
o	Define relationships between entities.
o	Apply normalization principles.

3.	Implement the Database in SQLite3
o	Create tables using SQL scripts.
o	Populate tables with collected data.
o	Write SQL queries to retrieve relevant information.

Step 3: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Due: Feb 24th By Noon)
•	Handle missing values appropriately.
•	Standardize numerical values where necessary.
•	Encode categorical variables for compatibility with machine learning models.
•	Conduct a series of descriptive statistics and data visualizations based on the data types.

Step 4: Research Questions & Analysis Methods (Due: March 10th By Noon)
Students must either select from the provided research questions or, based on their selected entities, formulate similar research questions ensuring alignment with their dataset.
A. Time Series Analysis
1.	How do inflation and GDP growth trends evolve over time for different regions?
2.	Can time series forecasting models predict future public debt levels based on historical data?
B. Hypothesis Testing - Statistical Comparisons
3.	Is there a significant difference in GDP growth rates between high-debt and low-debt countries? (T-Test)
4.	Do developing and developed countries differ significantly in public debt levels? (T-Test)
5.	Is there a significant association between a country's income level and its ability to manage debt? (Chi-Square Test)
6.	Does government spending on social services vary significantly across income levels? (F-Test)
7.	Is inflation significantly higher in countries with high external debt? (T-Test)
8.	Is there a relationship between trade openness and economic growth levels? (Chi-Square Test)
C. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) - Predicting Outcomes
9.	How do inflation, trade balance, and government spending impact GDP growth?
10.	What are the main drivers of a country’s foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows?
11.	How does public debt influence a country’s economic growth?
12.	Does government expenditure on education and healthcare impact life expectancy?
13.	What factors determine a country's inflation rate?
D. Classification - Categorizing Countries Based on Economic & Debt Factors
14.	Based on economic indicators, can we classify countries into high-growth vs. low-growth? (Logistic Regression)
15.	Which countries are likely to default on public debt? (Random Forest)
16.	Based on social and financial indicators, can we classify countries into developed, emerging, and developing economies? (Decision Tree)
17.	Is there a relationship between a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio and its ability to sustain long-term economic growth? (Naïve Bayes)
18.	Can we predict whether a country’s poverty rate is above or below a certain threshold? (KNN)
E. Clustering - Identifying Economic & Public Debt Patterns
19.	Are there distinct clusters of countries based on economic growth, debt levels, and social development? (K-Means Clustering)
F. Neural Networks - Deep Learning for Economic Forecasting
20.	Can a neural network model predict GDP growth more accurately than traditional regression models?
21.	Can a neural network predict a country's risk of debt distress based on past economic indicators?
